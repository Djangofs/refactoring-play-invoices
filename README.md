# refactoring-play-invoices

This repo lays out the material presented in the first chapter of Martin Fowler's fantastic book "Refactoring", which can be downloaded for free [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/refactoring2). All credit and copyright for the refactor source code belongs to Martin Fowler and Pearson Education. 

The additions I have made include the test suite around the source code, and the presentation of the refactoring example in a step by step case with the test suite. The intention is to allow individuals to follow the example and attempt to implement the refactorings themselves, before checking against the model answer. It is also intended to show how tools such as linters and IDEs can help the refactoring process.
