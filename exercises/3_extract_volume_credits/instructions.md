# Refining the extracted function

Looking over the current code, the next obvious candidate for extracting into a function is the volume credit calculation. Try doing this using the techniques and style learnt in exercises 1 and 2. Notice also how this is easier 

## Tasks
1. Extract the volume credits calculation into its own function.
2. Refine the function variable names to match the style employed in `amountFor` and `playFor`.

Note that due to removing the temporary variable `play` earlier it is now easier to extract the volume credits calculation.
