# Creating the HTML statement
Now that we've seperated the `createStatementData` function, we can easily write a new function to create a HTML statement. New tests have been added to the test file for this function. 

## Tasks
1. Write the htmlStatement function so that it passes the provided tests.

## Hints
You'll need to change the require statement in `6.test.js` to run tests against the start code, not the finished code.
